# configs

Config files for dev tools I use.

## VSCode 

`snippets` holds snippet files for JS and JSX

## Bash

My `.bash_profile` uses a unicode character to act as the `$:` that is most commonly seen. 

It also displays git branch if the current dir is a git repo.

## ESLint

**The** linter for JS code. The config file extends airbnb and prettier plugins, so both would need to be installed.

```bash
npm i -D eslint-config-airbnb
npm i -D eslint-plugin-prettier
```
